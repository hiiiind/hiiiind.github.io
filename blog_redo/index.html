       <p>Hello there, my friends! I am so moved to share this image with you, here is my childhood home (^_^) unfortunately it was destroyed in 3012 to build a high-speed tunnel :( 
        But these are beautiful memories! How were your homes during your childhood? I was told you donâ€™t have a teleport door, is that true ?<br>  Tell me in comment! ^o^
